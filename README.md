About
-----

Plesk Sync is an add-on module for WHMCS to import, control, create and synchronize client hosting
accounts with your Plesk servers.

Synchronize hosting account statuses between WHMCS & Plesk.  Finds orphaned hosting accounts that are active in Plesk, but not in billing. Attempts to locates the real owner of the hosting account through domain/e-mail.  Imports and creates new clients with invoiced hosting account, including password.

Inconsistencies can start to arise during the nightly WHMCS cron job on the server to analyze due invoices and if necessary, change hosting status on the client server via Plesk API.

Plesk Sync displays all your client servers running the Plesk OS with a compatible API protocol. You can quickly show more detailed statistics such as: uptime, load averages, memory, disk, clients, domains, databases, and mail.

Browse a server to start paging through the client domain accounts existing in Plesk.  Accounts are color-coded, tells a diagnosis and resolution through action buttons and contains statistics on disk space and traffic, with a button for the complete client profile.
